# Introduction
 We have made a task-agnostic unified framework for SOD and COD via a contrastive distillation paradigm based on the agreeable binary segmentation nature. In the supervised setting, our framework performed competitively with the previous task-specific SOD and COD methods. In the unsupervised setting, our framework achieved superior performance on most SOD and COD benchmarks. As well, our work has a real-time inference speed.
