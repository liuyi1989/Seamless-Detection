We make the study to unify SOD and COD in a task-agnostic framework via a contrastive distillation paradigm, inspired by their agreeable nature of binary segmentation.

# Introduction
We make the first study to unify SOD and COD in a task agnostic framework via a contrastive distillation paradigm, inspired by their agreeable nature of binary segmentation.Details are illustrated in our paper:''Seamless Detection: Unifying Salient Object Detection and Camouflaged Object Detection''.
